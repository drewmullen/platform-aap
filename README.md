# platform-aap

This Terraform project creates an Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) instance on AWS using a modular approach with infrastructure and configuration management separated into distinct modules. The project provides a complete solution for deploying a single instance contianerized AAP environment with HashiCorp Vault integration for SSH key management.

## Architecture

The project has been refactored to use a modular structure:

- **Root module**: Contains the main configuration that orchestrates all modules
- **aap_instance module**: Contains all the infrastructure resources (VPC, EC2, ALB, etc.)
- **vault_ssh module**: Manages SSH key generation and Vault integration for SSH signing
- **aap_postinstall module**: Handles AAP configuration, job templates, and execution

This separation of concerns allows for independent development and testing of infrastructure, security, and configuration components, making the project more maintainable and flexible.

## Dependencies

This project has several key dependencies:

1. **AMI ID**: Requires an AMI ID from the output of the "demo-packer-aap" project, which creates a pre-configured AAP image
2. **HashiCorp Vault**: Integrates with Vault for SSH key signing and credential management
3. **AWS Resources**: Requires appropriate AWS permissions to create VPC, EC2, Route53, and ALB resources
4. **Let's Encrypt**: Uses ACME protocol for TLS certificate generation

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform v1.0.0 or newer installed
- Access to HashiCorp Vault for SSH key signing
- A registered domain in Route53 (for ALB and TLS setup)
- The AMI ID from a successful build of the demo-packer-aap project

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hashi-RedHat-APJ-Collab/platform-aap.git
   cd platform-aap
   ```

2. Copy the example variables file:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.auto.tfvars.example terraform.auto.tfvars
   export AAP_USERNAME=admin
   export AAP_PASSWORD=...
   ```

3. Edit `terraform.auto.tfvars` with your specific values:
   ```hcl
   create_alb = true
   ami_id      = "ami-0039772b0345c2e88"
   aws_region  = "ap-southeast-2"
   acme_email  = "simon.lynch@hashicorp.com"
   domain_name = "aap.simon-lynch.sbx.hashidemos.io"
   subject_alternative_names = [
     "aap.simon-lynch.sbx.hashidemos.io",
   ]
   route53_zone_name = "simon-lynch.sbx.hashidemos.io."
   aap_username = "admin"
   aap_password = "Hashi......"
   job_template_name = "Hashicorp Vault demo setup"
   vault_namespace = "admin/hashi-redhat"
   ssh_role_name = "ssh_demo"
   job_triggers = {
     "version1" = "4"
   }
   ```


3. Initialize and apply Terraform:

Today a targeted run is required, once Terraform 1.13 is out we can test deferred changes
alternative here is split the aap post install module into a second workspace or use Terraform stacks.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply -auto-approve -target module.aap_instance; terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

## Module Structure

The project is organized into a modular structure:

```

## Module Dependencies

The modules have the following dependencies:

- **vault_ssh module**: Generates SSH keys and integrates with Vault for SSH signing
- **aap_instance module**: Creates the infrastructure needed to host the AAP instance
- **aap_postinstall module**: Depends on both the aap_instance and vault_ssh modules:
  - Uses the public IP from the AAP instance
  - Uses SSH keys from vault_ssh
  - Waits for the ALB healthy target before executing jobs
  - Uses the domain configuration for URL construction

## ⚠️ ACME + Route 53 DNS Challenge

This project uses the [ACME Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/vancluever/acme/latest) to automatically generate TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt using the DNS-01 challenge via AWS Route 53.


## Outputs

The root module exposes outputs from all submodules:

### Infrastructure Outputs (from aap_instance module)

- `public_ip`: Public IP address of the AAP instance
- `public_fqdn`: Public FQDN of the AAP instance
- `instance_id`: ID of the AAP instance
- `alb_dns_name`: DNS name of the ALB (if created)
- `route53_record_name`: Route53 record name for the ALB (if created)
- `vpc_id`: ID of the VPC
- `security_group_id`: ID of the security group
- `key_pair_name`: Name of the key pair
- `private_key_pem`: Private key in PEM format (sensitive)

### Vault SSH Outputs (from vault_ssh module)

- `unsigned_ssh_public_key`: SSH unsigned public key
- `unsigned_ssh_private_key`: SSH unsigned private key (sensitive)
- `approle_role_id`: Vault AppRole role ID
- `approle_secret_id`: Vault AppRole secret ID (sensitive)

### AAP Configuration Outputs (from aap_postinstall module)

- `aap_job_template_id`: ID of the AAP job template
- `aap_url`: AAP URL (either ALB domain or instance IP)
- `aap_job_id`: ID of the executed AAP job

## Security Features

This project implements several security best practices:

1. **TLS Encryption**: Automatic HTTPS setup with Let's Encrypt certificates
2. **Private Key Protection**: Sensitive outputs are marked as such in Terraform
3. **SSH Key Signing**: Integration with HashiCorp Vault for SSH certificate authentication
4. **Network Isolation**: Custom VPC with private subnets and security groups
5. **Least Privilege**: IAM roles with minimum required permissions

## Infrastructure Components

The `aap_instance` module provisions:

- A custom VPC with public and private subnets
- An EC2 instance with the AAP AMI
- An Application Load Balancer with HTTPS listeners (optional)
- Route53 DNS records for the ALB or EC2 instance
- Security groups with least-privilege access controls
- TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt and ACME protocol
- SSH key pair for instance access

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks include:

- Updating the AMI ID when new AAP versions are released
- Reviewing security group rules periodically
- Rotating credentials (if not using Vault dynamic credentials)
- Updating Terraform providers when new versions are available

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Certificate Generation Failures**: Ensure AWS_REGION is set and Route53 has proper permissions
2. **Connection Timeouts**: Check security group rules and network ACLs
3. **AAP Job Failures**: Examine AAP logs via the web UI or SSH into the instance
